			<p>
				Special forces have played an important role throughout the history of warfare, whenever the aim was to achieve disruption by "hit
				and run" and sabotage, rather than more traditional conventional combat. Other significant roles lay in reconnaissance, providing
				essential intelligence from near or among the enemy and increasingly in combating irregular forces, their infrastructure and
				activities. Chinese strategist Jiang Ziya, in his Six Secret Teachings, described recruiting talented and motivated men into
				specialized elite units with functions such as commanding heights and making rapid long-distance advances. Hamilcar Barca in
				Sicily (249 BC) had specialized troops trained to launch several offensives per day. In the late Roman or early Byzantine
				period, Roman fleets used small, fast, camouflaged ships crewed by selected men for scouting and commando missions. Muslim
				forces also had naval special operations units, including one that used camouflaged ships to gather intelligence and launch
				raids and another of soldiers who could pass for Crusaders who would use ruses to board enemy ships and then capture and
				destroy them. In Japan, ninjas were used for reconnaissance, espionage and as assassins, bodyguards or fortress guards,
				or otherwise fought alongside conventional soldiers. During the Napoleonic wars, rifle and sapper units were formed that
				held specialised roles in reconnaissance and skirmishing and were not committed to the formal battle lines.

		<h2 style="color:white;">First specialized units</h2>
			<p>
				The British Indian Army deployed two special forces during their border wars:
				the Corps of Guides formed in 1846 and the Gurkha Scouts (a force that was formed in the 1890s and was first used as a detached unit during the 1897–1898 Tirah Campaign).
				During the Second Boer War (1899–1902) the British Army felt the need for more specialised units became most apparent.
				Scouting units such as the Lovat Scouts, a Scottish Highland regiment made up of exceptional woodsmen outfitted in ghillie suits and well practised in the arts of marksmanship,
				field craft, and military tactics filled this role.
				This unit was formed in 1900 by Lord Lovat and early on reported to an American,
				Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the Chief of Scouts under Lord Roberts.
				After the war, Lovat's Scouts went on to formally become the British Army's first sniper unit.
				Additionally, the Bushveldt Carbineers, formed in 1901, can be seen as an early unconventional warfare unit.

			Admiral William H. McRaven, formerly the ninth commanding officer of the U.S. Special Operations Command (2011–2014), described two approaches to special forces operations in the 2012 posture statement to the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services: "the direct approach is characterized by technologically enabled small-unit precision lethality, focused intelligence, and inter-agency cooperation integrated on a digitally-networked battlefield", whereas the "indirect approach includes empowering host nation forces, providing appropriate assistance to humanitarian agencies, and engaging key populations."
			Elements of national power must be deployed in concert without over-reliance on a single capability, such as special forces, that leaves the entire force unprepared and hollow across the spectrum of military operations.
			Throughout the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st century, special forces have come to higher prominence, as governments have found objectives can sometimes be better achieved by a small team of anonymous specialists than a larger and much more politically controversial conventional deployment. In both Kosovo and Afghanistan, special forces were used to co-ordinate activities between local guerrilla fighters and air power.
			Typically, guerrilla fighters would engage enemy soldiers and tanks causing them to move, where they could be seen and attacked from the air.
			Special forces have been used in both wartime and peacetime military operations such as the Laotian Civil War, Bangladesh Liberation War-1971, Vietnam War, Portuguese Colonial War, South African Border War, Falklands War, The Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Jaffna University Helidrop, the first and second Gulf Wars, Afghanistan, Croatia, Kosovo, Bosnia, the first and second Chechen Wars, the Iranian Embassy siege (London), the Air France Flight 8969 (Marseille), Operation Defensive Shield, Operation Khukri, the Moscow theater hostage crisis, Operation Orchard, the Japanese Embassy hostage crisis (Lima), in Sri Lanka against the LTTE, the raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, the 2016 Indian Line of Control strike and the 2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar.
			The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan involved special forces from several coalition nations, who played a major role in removing the Taliban from power in 2001–2002. Special forces have continued to play a role in combating the Taliban in subsequent operations.
			As gender restrictions are being removed in parts of the world, females are applying for special forces units selections and in 2014 the Norwegian Special Operation Forces established an all female unit Jegertroppen (English: Jeger Troop).
